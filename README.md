This repository showcases a collection of Ethereum smart contracts developed for a portfolio project. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in blockchain development and secure coding practices. The contracts have been developed and tested using Remix.

## Features

- **Smart Contracts**: A set of Ethereum smart contracts written in **Solidity**.
- **Documentation**: Each contract includes detailed comments explaining its functionality, design choices, and usage.
- **Testing**: Contracts have been thoroughly tested using Remix's built-in testing features.
- **Deployment**: Instructions on deploying the contracts using Remix.

## Contracts

1. **Token Contract**: An ERC-20 token implementation.
2. **Crowdsale Contract**: A contract for managing token sales.
3. **MultiSig Wallet Contract**: A multi-signature wallet for secure fund management.

## Testing

The smart contracts have been tested using Remix's integrated testing environment. To run the tests:

1. Open the contract file in Remix.
2. Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab.
3. Compile the contract by clicking the "Compile" button.
4. Switch to the "Test" tab.
5. Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy" button.
6. Interact with the contract using the provided test cases.

## Deployment

To deploy the contracts using Remix:

1. Open the contract file in Remix.
2. Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab.
3. Compile the contract by clicking the "Compile" button.
4. Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
5. Select the desired network (e.g., Rinkeby, Mainnet).
6. Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
7. Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy" button.
8. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## Assumptions

Due to time constraints, this project lacks:

- User Selector
- Pagination
- Good Test Coverage
- Better Comments / Documentation Strings
- Modern Frontend Framework (like React)
- Proper UX / UI design (currently uses plain Bootstrap)
